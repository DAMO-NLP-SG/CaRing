To solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many sentences Janice typed today.
2. Subtract the sentences she had to erase.
3. Subtract the number of sentences typed today from the total to determine how many sentences she started with.

Given the problem, we can use the following calculations:

1. Sentences typed today = \(6 \times (20 + 15 + 18)\)
2. Correct sentences typed today = Sentences typed today - 40
3. Sentences at the start = Total sentences at the end of today - Correct sentences typed today
