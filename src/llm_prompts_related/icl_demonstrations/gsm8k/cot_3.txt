sent3 -> int1: Jesse runs 2 miles in the first three days because 3 x (2/3) = 2; int1 & sent2 & sent4 -> int2: Jesse has 18 miles left to run because 30 - 10 - 2 = 18; int2 & sent6 -> int3: Jesse has to run an average of 6 miles a day because 18 / 3 = 6; sent5 -> int4: Mia runs 12 miles over the first four days because 4 x 3 = 12; int4 & sent2 -> int5: She has 18 miles left to run because 30 - 12 = 18; int5 & sent6 -> int6: She has to run six miles a day because 18 / 3 = 6; int3 & int6 -> int7: The total they both have to run is 12 miles a day; int7 & sent6 -> int8: The average they have to run per day on average is 6 miles because 12 / 2 = 6; int8 & sent6 -> int9: The answer is 6;
