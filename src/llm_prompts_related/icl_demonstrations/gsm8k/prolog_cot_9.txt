To solve this problem, let's break it down:

1. From the carwash, Hank donates \(90\% \times \$100\).
2. From the bake sale, Hank donates \(75\% \times \$80\).
3. From mowing lawns, Hank donates \(100\% \times \$50\).

The total donation by Hank is the sum of the above three amounts.

Given the problem:

Total donated by Hank = \(0.9 \times 100 + 0.75 \times 80 + 1 \times 50\)
