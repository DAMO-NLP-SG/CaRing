Let's break down the problem:

1. Cost for the venue: $10,000.
2. Cost per guest: $500.
3. John wants 50 guests, so the cost for his guests would be \(50 \times 500\).
4. John's wife wants 60% more guests than John. This would be \(0.6 \times 50 = 30\) more guests, so she wants a total of \(50 + 30 = 80\) guests. The cost for her guests would be \(80 \times 500\).

The total wedding cost if John's wife gets her way is the sum of the venue cost and the cost for all 80 guests.

Given the problem:

Total wedding cost = \(10,000 + 500 \times 80\)
