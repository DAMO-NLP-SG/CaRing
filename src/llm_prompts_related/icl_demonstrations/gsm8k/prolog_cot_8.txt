Let's break down the problem:

1. The school band's goal: $150.
2. From three families: $10 each, so \(3 \times 10 = $30\).
3. From 15 families: $5 each, so \(15 \times 5 = $75\).
4. Money collected so far: \(30 + 75 = $105\).

The amount more they need to reach their goal is: \(150 - 105 = $45\).

Given the problem:

Amount needed to reach goal = \(150 - (3 \times 10 + 15 \times 5)\)
