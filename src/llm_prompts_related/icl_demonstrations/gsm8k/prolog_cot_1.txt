Let's break down the problem step by step.

From the given information:

Tina's hourly wage = $18.00
Overtime is applicable after 8 hours.
Overtime wage = hourly wage + 0.5 * hourly wage = 1.5 * hourly wage
She works 10 hours every day for 5 days, which means:
8 hours of regular wage per day and
2 hours of overtime wage per day for 5 days.
Let's compute her earnings:

Regular earnings per day = 8 hours * hourly wage
Overtime earnings per day = 2 hours * overtime wage
Total earnings per day = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings for 5 days = 5 * Total earnings per day
