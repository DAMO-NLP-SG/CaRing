Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. GiGi cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.
2. Kenny used 38 mushroom pieces.
3. Karla used 42 mushroom pieces.
4. There were 8 mushroom pieces remaining on the cutting board.

To find the total number of mushroom pieces:
Total pieces = Kenny's pieces + Karla's pieces + Remaining pieces

Now, since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, the number of mushrooms GiGi cut up at the beginning is:
Total mushrooms = Total pieces รท 4
