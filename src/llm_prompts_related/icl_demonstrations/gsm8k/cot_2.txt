sent0 -> int1: Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today.; sent1 & sent3 -> int2: Janice typed 6 * 20 = 120 sentences before her break.; sent1 & sent4 -> int3: She typed 6 * 15 = 90 sentences after her break.; sent1 & sent6 -> int4: She typed 6 * 18 = 108 sentences after her meeting.; int2 & int3 & int4 -> int5: Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = 318 sentences today in all.; int5 & sent5 -> int6: She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = 278 sentences that she typed today left.; int1 & int6 & sent7 -> int7: The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today.; int7 & sent8 -> int8: Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = 258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today.; int8 & sent8 -> int9: The answer is 258;
