Let's break down the problem:

1. First hour: Joanne collected 15 coins.
2. Next two hours: She collected 35 coins each hour, so a total of \(2 \times 35\) coins.
3. Fourth hour: She collected 50 coins but gave 15 to her coworker. So she's left with \(50 - 15\).

We sum up the coins she collected over the four hours to get the total number of coins she has.

Given the problem:

Total coins after fourth hour = \(15 + 2 \times 35 + (50 - 15)\)
