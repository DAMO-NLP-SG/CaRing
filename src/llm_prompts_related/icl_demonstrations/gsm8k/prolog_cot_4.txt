Let's break down the problem:

1. Jeremy played a three-letter word on a triple word score and earned thirty points.
2. Before the score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point.
3. We need to determine the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled.

Given the problem, we can create the following equation:

\[ 3 \times (\text{first letter value} + \text{middle letter value} + \text{third letter value}) = 30 \]

From the problem, we know:
\[ \text{first letter value} = 1 \]
\[ \text{third letter value} = 1 \]

Plugging in these values, the equation becomes:
\[ 3 \times (1 + \text{middle letter value} + 1) = 30 \]
