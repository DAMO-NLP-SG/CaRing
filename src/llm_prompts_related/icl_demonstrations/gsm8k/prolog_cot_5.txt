To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Convert the batch size from gallons to ounces (since consumption rate is given in ounces).
2. Calculate how much coffee Jack consumes over 24 days.
3. Calculate how many batches Jack needs to make over 24 days.
4. Multiply the number of batches by the time it takes to make one batch to get the total time Jack spends making coffee over 24 days.

Given the information:

1. There are 128 ounces in a gallon.
2. Jack's batch size = \(1.5 \times 128\)
3. Consumption over 24 days = \( \frac{96 \times 24}{2} \)
4. Batches needed = \( \frac{\text{consumption over 24 days}}{\text{batch size}} \)
5. Total time spent = batches needed \(\times 20\)
