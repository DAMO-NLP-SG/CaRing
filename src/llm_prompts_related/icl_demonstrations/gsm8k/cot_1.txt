sent1 & sent2 -> int1: She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $144.00 per 8-hour shift; sent2 & sent3 & sent5 -> int2: She works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = 2 hours of overtime; int1 & sent4 -> int3: Overtime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $9.00; int1 & int3 -> int4: Her overtime pay is 18+9 = $27.00; int1 & sent5 -> int5: Her base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $720.00; int2 & int4 -> int6: Her overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $54.00 in overtime pay; int6 & sent5 -> int7: 2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00; int5 & int7 & sent6 -> int8: In 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $990.00; int8 & sent6 -> int9: The answer is 990;
