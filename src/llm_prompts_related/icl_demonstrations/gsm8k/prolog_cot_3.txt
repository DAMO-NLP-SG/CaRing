To solve this problem using Prolog, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Jesse ran over the first four days.
2. Calculate the total distance Mia ran over the first four days.
3. Subtract the distances from the 30 miles they need to run to determine how much they each have left.
4. Determine the average miles they have to run over the final three days.
5. Find the average of their averages.
